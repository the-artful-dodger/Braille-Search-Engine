# Braille-Search-Engine
This is a search engine that retrieves text only search results and converts them into braille in a format that can easily be printed using a braille printer.

All files are inside the folder. The pptx etc are pretty useless and are for college purposes only.
The filenames are self explanatory.
res.html is a sample output, supported on Chrome, Opera and Firefox.
